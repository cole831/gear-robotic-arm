# AI Robotic Arm Project

An open-source **AI-powered robotic arm** developed by the **Gavilan Engineering & Research Club**.  
This project integrates **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **robotic control** to create a smart robotic arm capable of recognizing and interacting with its environment.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, build, and program a robotic arm that can:
- Detect and track objects using **computer vision**
- Perform movement tasks using **AI-based control**
- Simulate arm kinematics and motion planning
- Run in both **simulation** and **real hardware**

This project is organized and developed collaboratively by club members across hardware, AI, and control systems teams. This results in 3 teams dedicated to each of the respective engineering fields. 
### Mechanical Engineering Team

In charge of designing and printing the parts for the arm.

### Electrical Engineering Team

In charge of researching and wiring components.
### Computer Engineering Team

In charge of AI model and other code for the arm, including the camera, motors, and interface.
