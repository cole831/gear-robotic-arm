An layer of code to be run on the raspberry pi that sits between the AI issuing these commands(Also on the Pi) and the actual motor code itself(Likely on the arduino).
Obviously unfinished since we dont have the actual motors yet but when they appear I will write that in and we can figure out how to do the inter-board communication. 
Cole mentioned somthing about I2C communication and hosting a bunch of motors over an arduino. Somthing he heard of someone else doing- a redit thread.
